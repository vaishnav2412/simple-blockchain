# ðŸ§± Simple Blockchain Simulation

This is a basic blockchain simulation built with Python. It demonstrates core blockchain concepts like block structure, hashing, proof-of-work, and tamper detection.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Block Structure**: Each block contains an index, timestamp, list of transactions, previous block's hash, and a nonce (for proof-of-work).
- **Hashing**: Utilizes SHA-256 to ensure data integrity.
- **Proof-of-Work**: Implements a mining mechanism requiring computational effort to add new blocks.
- **Blockchain Management**: Includes methods to create the genesis block, add new blocks, and validate chain integrity.
- **Tamper Detection**: Validates the chain to detect any unauthorized modifications.
